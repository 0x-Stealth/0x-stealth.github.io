# First Post!

I decided to make a blog because well..

Blogs are cool, and I have a place to discuss my discoveries and creations

I'll probably mainly be sharing code samples, project ideas and updates, and generally just other things i find "important" enough to ramble about.

By no means will this blog be consistent, it'll be whenever I discover shit (and like 90% of my projects go unfinished because I just utterly cannot be bothered.)

However! I will also be releasing things like *custom* Cobalt Strike documentation *written by me*, because to be fair the **official documentation sucks**.

And no one has money to pay for **expensive as shit courses** considering ~~we~~ almost everyone who uses Cobalt cracks it, because **no one is paying god knows however much it is**... is what I would say if I didn't pay for it, but I 100% did! I am a law obiding citizen and I believe tools and information should be locked behind paywalls instead of being free!


Regardless, I rate this yap session 7/10, and more will be following.
