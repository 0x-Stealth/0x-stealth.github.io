There's not much to say about. I'm a "hacker", hate the word but it's the best description. I make malware and POCs for fun, most of it is slop since it's easier to get shit out fast, but sometimes I make good shit. Usually, it's not public, but you might find some of my slop here, and occasionally the good shit if I like it enough to publish it or something.

World's going to shit, as such I use Programming and Hacking as a distraction from it. Depressing, I know. I've been in this field for 4 or 5 years at this point, and the general technology field for about 7 or more, I stopped counting after like, four.
Note: Sometimes my posts will just go into rants about some stupid shit like the government or depression or some shit. Just ignore it.
